    "content": "<strong>Here is how I can help!</strong> Being a self-taught developer, I learned the hard way. Most of the beginners also fall in the common pitfall of learning dev tools and tech in isolation without really understanding how they can connect the dots to build a real-world project. They end up getting tired of the process, making them stop learning. Only for them to revisit the learnings all over again. If not careful, they end up repeating the cycle."
